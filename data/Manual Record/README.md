From the box plot, we can observe that:

- Some genotypes such as Rapid_Cycling_Rape_CrGC5 and SWU_Chinese_1 showed earlier flowering time.
- While genotypes such as LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA and POH_285_Bolko showed later flowering time.

This difference reflects the different responsiveness of different genotypes to temperature and photoperiod. Early-flowering genotypes may have a faster growth cycle and be suitable for short-season planting, while late-flowering genotypes may be more suitable for long-season planting and have a longer vegetative growth period.

From this figure, we can observe:

- Some genotypes such as MADRIGAL_x_RECITAL_DH_LINE and Express showed taller inflorescences.
- While genotypes such as Liho and RAPID_CYCLING_RAPE_CrGC5 showed shorter inflorescences.

This height difference may reflect different growth strategies of different genotypes. Taller plants may be more advantageous for light capture and pollination, but they may also require more resource investment; shorter plants may be more adapted to certain environmental conditions, such as windy areas.

From this figure, we can observe:

- Some genotypes such as SLAPSKA_SLAPY and ABUKUMA_NATANE showed longer flowering periods.
- While genotypes such as Rocket and Quinta showed shorter flowering periods.

The length of the flowering period may affect pollination efficiency and seed yield. Genotypes with longer flowering periods may have an advantage in unstable environments as they have more opportunities for pollination. On the other hand, genotypes with shorter flowering periods may be more suitable for completing their life cycle quickly in stable environments.

Analysis based on the three images:

| Analysis | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Differences between genotypes | As can be seen from Figure 1, there are significant differences in the average flowering time of different genotypes. For example, genotypes such as RAPID_CYCLING_RAPE_CrGC5, Liho, and SWU_Chinese_1 show earlier flowering times (about 70-80 days), while genotypes such as LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA, SLAPSKA_SLAPY, and POH_285_Bolko show later flowering times (more than 100 days). This difference reflects the genetic variation of different genotypes in growth cycle and environmental adaptability. |
| Temperature response | Comparing Figure 2 (5째C) and Figure 3 (10째C), it can be found that the flowering time of most genotypes is slightly delayed at higher temperatures. This phenomenon may be related to vernalization. At 5째C, the flowering time of many genotypes was concentrated between 85 and 95 days, while at 10째C, the distribution of flowering time was more dispersed, and some genotypes even delayed flowering to after 100 days. |
| Temperature sensitivity | Different genotypes have different degrees of sensitivity to temperature changes. For example, LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA showed significant flowering delay when the temperature increased, while some genotypes such as Liho and SWU_Chinese_1 had relatively stable flowering times at both temperatures. This difference reflects the different vernalization requirements among genotypes. |
| Degree of variation | As can be seen from the box plots in Figures 2 and 3, some genotypes (such as SLAPSKA_SLAPY and POH_285_Bolko) showed large flowering time variation under the same temperature conditions, while other genotypes (such as Express and Canberra_x_Courage_DH_LINE) showed more consistent performance. This variation may reflect genetic diversity within the genotype or sensitivity to microenvironmental changes. |
| Ecological adaptability | Early flowering genotypes (such as RAPID_CYCLING_RAPE_CrGC5) may be more suitable for short growing seasons or rapid rotation systems, while late flowering genotypes (such as LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA) may be more suitable for long growing seasons or environments requiring long-term vegetative growth. This diversity provides room for selection in different climates and agricultural systems. |
| Breeding potential | These data reveal the rich genetic diversity of rapeseed genotypes in flowering time, providing valuable resources for breeding work. For example, early flowering genotypes can be used to breed varieties adapted to short seasons, or genotypes that are insensitive to temperature can be used to breed varieties with wider adaptability. |
| Impact of climate change | The effect of temperature on flowering time suggests that climate change may have an important impact on the crop growth cycle. Understanding the temperature response characteristics of different genotypes will help predict and respond to the impact of future climate change on agricultural production. |
