![average_first_flowering_time](https://github.com/Tshoiasc/Brassica-napus-growth-research/assets/30382941/d046a84f-d237-4f3a-bde6-60feac1f2c4e)

From the box plot, we can observe that:

- Some genotypes such as Rapid_Cycling_Rape_CrGC5 and SWU_Chinese_1 showed earlier flowering time.
- While genotypes such as LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA and POH_285_Bolko showed later flowering time.

This difference reflects the different responsiveness of different genotypes to temperature and photoperiod. Early-flowering genotypes may have a faster growth cycle and be suitable for short-season planting, while late-flowering genotypes may be more suitable for long-season planting and have a longer vegetative growth period.

From this figure, we can observe:

- Some genotypes such as MADRIGAL_x_RECITAL_DH_LINE and Express showed taller inflorescences.
- While genotypes such as Liho and RAPID_CYCLING_RAPE_CrGC5 showed shorter inflorescences.

This height difference may reflect different growth strategies of different genotypes. Taller plants may be more advantageous for light capture and pollination, but they may also require more resource investment; shorter plants may be more adapted to certain environmental conditions, such as windy areas.

From this figure, we can observe:

- Some genotypes such as SLAPSKA_SLAPY and ABUKUMA_NATANE showed longer flowering periods.
- While genotypes such as Rocket and Quinta showed shorter flowering periods.

The length of the flowering period may affect pollination efficiency and seed yield. Genotypes with longer flowering periods may have an advantage in unstable environments as they have more opportunities for pollination. On the other hand, genotypes with shorter flowering periods may be more suitable for completing their life cycle quickly in stable environments.

From this figure, we can observe:

- Some genotypes such as LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA and SLAPSKA_SLAPY showed significant delay in flowering time at 10°C (ratio greater than 1).
- While genotypes such as SWU_Chinese_1 and Zhouyou showed earlier flowering time at 10°C (ratio less than 1).

This difference in temperature responsiveness reflects the different sensitivity of different genotypes to vernalization. Genotypes with strong response to temperature changes may be more suitable for planting in areas with large temperature variations, while genotypes with less pronounced response may be more suitable for temperature-stable environments.

Analysis based on the three images:

| Observation Point | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 1. Overall distribution of flowering time | - Mean flowering time of most genotypes concentrated between 80-100 days<br>- Some genotypes like RAPID_CYCLING_RAPE_CrGC5 and Liho show earlier flowering time (about 70-80 days) at both temperatures<br>- LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA and SLAPSKA_SLAPY show significantly delayed flowering time (more than 100 days)<br>- Reflects wide genetic variation of rapeseed genotypes in growth cycle and environmental adaptability |
| 2. Diversity of temperature response | - Most genotypes have a slight delay in flowering time under 10°C conditions<br>- LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA shows greater delay and variation at 10°C<br>- SWU_Chinese_1 and Zhouyou performed relatively stably at both temperatures<br>- Reflects different vernalization requirements and regulatory mechanisms to cope with temperature changes |
| 3. Intra-population variation | - Variation within the same genotype observed<br>- POH_285_Bolko showed large intra-population variation at 10°C<br>- May arise from genetic diversity or high sensitivity to microenvironmental changes |
| 4. Temperature sensitivity | - Genotypes like Ningyou_7 and Zhongshuang_II show large differences in flowering time distribution at two temperatures<br>- Indicates high sensitivity to temperature changes<br>- Valuable trait for breeding, especially in context of climate change |
| 5. Stable genotypes | - Genotypes like Express and Canberra_x_Courage_DH_LINE showed consistent flowering time distribution under both temperature conditions<br>- Valuable trait for crops grown in areas with large temperature fluctuations |
| 6. Extreme phenotypes | - LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA showed extremely late flowering individuals (about 130 days) under 10°C conditions<br>- May have special research value for understanding flowering time regulation mechanisms |
| 7. Ecological adaptability indication | - Early flowering and stable genotypes may suit agricultural systems with short growing seasons or rapid crop rotation<br>- Late flowering or temperature-sensitive genotypes may suit long growing seasons or specific climatic conditions |
| 8. Inference of vernalization requirements | - Genotypes flowering significantly earlier at 5°C than at 10°C may have stronger vernalization requirement<br>- Those performing similarly at both temperatures may have weaker or no vernalization requirement |
| 9. Breeding potential assessment | - Data provides rich information for breeding work<br>- Early-maturing and stable genotypes can be selected for short season adaptation<br>- Temperature-sensitive genotypes can be used for specific climatic condition adaptation |
| 10. Genotype classification | - Early-maturing types (e.g., RAPID_CYCLING_RAPE_CrGC5)<br>- Late-maturing types (e.g., LEMBKES_MALCHOWER_LENORA)<br>- Temperature-sensitive types (e.g., Ningyou_7)<br>- Temperature-stable types (e.g., Express)<br>- Classification guides future research and breeding work |
| 11. Potential molecular mechanisms | - Observed phenotypic differences likely reflect variations in underlying molecular mechanisms<br>- May involve expression regulation of flowering hormone genes (e.g., FLC, FT)<br>- Could include variations in sensing pathways of photoperiod and temperature<br>- Provides direction for further molecular biology research |
