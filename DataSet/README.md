# Dataset
This dataset is from the reserach (Collection of side view and top view RGB images of Brassica napus from a large scale, high throughput experiment).

### Image Dataset Description:

Top and side view RGB png images as analysed for 'Integrated Phenomics and Genomics reveals genetic loci associated with inflorescence growth in Brassica napus'.
Image collection details and examples of analysis are provided in the body and appendices of the paper.
The images were collected over a six week period, usually on a daily basis.
71 genotypes, two treatments, three replicates; total 426 plants.
1×top view image, 3×side view images (000, 045 & 090° rotations).

This dataset is used to train the neural network model for simulating the growth of rapeseed plants. The data annotation adopts a hierarchical recursive method based on the biological growth characteristics of rapeseed:
