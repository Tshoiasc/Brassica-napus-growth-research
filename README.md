## 🚀 Key Components
```bash
Algorithm
branch_extraction_and_bud_tracking: Implements the novel branch extraction algorithm and flower bud tracking for Brassica napus.
feature_match: Includes both SIFT and ResNet50 for feature matching between images.
Annotation
label-studio-ml-backend: A custom inference backend built for Label Studio to assist with semi-automated annotation of Brassica napus data.
Models
flower_bud_detection_model: Modified YOLOv8 for accurate detection of flower buds in Brassica napus images.
prediction_stgcn: Spatio-temporal graph convolutional network for predicting plant growth.
SmaAt+GAN: A hybrid model combining SmaAt-UNet and GAN to generate high-quality images for better plant phenotyping.
Phenotyping Tool
front-end: User interface built for interacting with the phenotyping tool.
back-end: Server-side logic for processing phenotypic data and interacting with models.
```
## 🔧 Installation
```bash
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/Tshoiasc/Brassica-napus-growth-research.git
Install the required dependencies:


cd brassica_napus_phenotyping_tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
